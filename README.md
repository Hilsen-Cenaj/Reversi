# Reversi
This project has been made for the course *Artificial Intelligence* offered by the Athens University of Economics and Business at the fall semester of 2020.<br>
The **MinMax Algorithm** is used to determine the depth search.<br>
The user can play a game called Reversi. He can choose the difficulty of the game with the depth option. The program has rules to determine the user's moves or if he has no moves and in the end declares a winner.
